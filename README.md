# Student Score Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts student exam scores based on various performance factors. The project utilizes Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to analyze the relationship between study hours and exam scores.

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they have studied. By leveraging machine learning techniques, educational institutions can identify students who might be at risk of underperforming and provide timely support. The project demonstrates the entire workflow of a machine learning project, from data cleaning and exploration to model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## How to Use
